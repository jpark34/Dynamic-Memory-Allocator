# malloclab
Wrote own versions of the malloc, free, and realloc C functions. Only file I modified was mm.c, all of the rest were given to me from my professor for our project. Our implementation used an implicit free list to keep track of all free blocks. My partner and I attempted to then build a segregated free list in order to increase our throughput and efficiency when testing. However, we were unable to complete it in time for turn in.
